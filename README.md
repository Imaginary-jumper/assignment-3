task 1 (factorial): the code first asks user for a integer input then initiate a process in function names factorial as its called at the very last of the code. in the function factorial, it check 1st whther the input is less than 2 if yes the answer is 1 , otherwise it will go into a loop where a local variable is mentioned b=1 and in the loop it starts from 1 to the number user inserted (since the range function ends before the prescribed end , variable is set to a+1) , now every time the loop runs it keeps on multiplying the numbers and store the value in b which is later called to get the answer.

task 2: just used the maths functions as it was intended to get the output desired.
